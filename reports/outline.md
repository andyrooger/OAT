Introduction
============

You should be able to clearly explain what the problem is, why the problem is important and why it is difficult to address.
You should also be able to succinctly describe your main idea and what issues need to be addressed.
Also see guidelines on the final report.

Background
==========

By now you should have studied most of the background work, so the background section of your outline report should already contain most of the contents of the background section of your final report.

Body
====

At this stage you should be able to explain the main aspects of the solution that your project proposes.
For more implementation based projects you should have already the main aspects of the architecture, the outline of the algorithms, etc.
In essence, you should be able to write a specification of the solution in such level of detail that if given to an external programmer he should be able to implement it.
Of course, some aspects of the solution may be missing, in which case you should be able to explain the main idea for tackling them.

Evaluation
==========

You should be able to explain how you are going to evaluate the resulting solution of the project in some amount of detail.
In particular you should explain which aspects need to be evaluated for comparison with existing prior work, what qualitative and quantitative aspects will need evaluating, which tests and benchmarks you will run, etc.

Plan of Work
============

You must explain what remains to be done in order to complete the project and roughly what you expect the timetable to be (allowing sufficient time to write the final report, presentation and work on the final demonstration).
It is not sufficient to simply give a timetable, you must also explain what the fall-back positions are if you run out of time and what extensions can be added if you have more time.
You should be able to succinctly discuss the relative priority of the remaining tasks and its rationale.
