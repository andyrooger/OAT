Introduction
============

> You should be able to clearly explain what the problem is, why the problem is important and why it is difficult to address.
> You should also be able to succinctly describe your main idea and what issues need to be addressed.
> Also see guidelines on the final report.
>
> Final:
>
> This is one of the most important components of the report.
> It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader.
> It should summarise everything you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background, relevance and main contributions.
> It should explain the motivation for the project (i.e., why the problem is important) and identify the issues to be addressed (i.e., why the problem is difficult).
> The introduction should set the scene for the project and should provide the reader with a summary of the key things to look out for in the remainder of the report.
> When detailing the contributions it is helpful to provide pointers to the section(s) of the report that provide the relevant technical details.
> The introduction itself should be largely non-technical.
> It is sometimes useful to state the main objectives of the project as part of the introduction.
> However, avoid the temptation to list low-level objectives one after another in the introduction and then later, in the evaluation section (see below), say something like "All the objectives of the project have been met blah blah...".
> A project that meets all its objectives is, by definition, weak and unambitious.
> Concentrate instead on the big issues, e.g. the main questions (scientific or otherwise) that the project sets out to answer

Background
==========

> By now you should have studied most of the background work, so the background section of your outline report should already contain most of the contents of the background section of your final report.
>
> Final:
>
> The background section of the report should set the project into context by relating it to existing published work which you read at the start of the project when your approach and methods were being considered.
> There are usually many ways of solving a given problem, and you shouldn't just pick one at random.
> Describe and evaluate as many alternative approaches as possible.
> The published work may be in the form of research papers, articles, text books, technical manuals, or even existing software or hardware of which you have had hands-on experience.
> Your must acknowledge the sources of your inspiration.
> You are expected to have seen and thought about other people's ideas; your contribution will be putting them into practice in some other context.
> However, avoid plagiarism: if you take another person's work as your own and do not cite your sources of information/inspiration you are being dishonest; in other words you are cheating.
> When referring to other pieces of work, cite the sources where they are referred to or used, rather than just listing them at the end.
> Make sure you read and digest the Department's plagiarism document.

> In writing the Background chapter you must demonstrate your capability of analysis, synthesis and critical judgement.
> Analysis is shown by explaining how the proposed solution operates in your own words as well as its benefits and consequences.
> Synthesis is shown through the organisation of your Related Work section and through identifying and generalising common aspects across different solutions.
> Critical judgement is shown by discussing the limitations of the solutions proposed both in terms of their disadvantages and limits of applicability.
>
> Typically you can look for Background work using different search engines including:
>
> * Google Scholar
> * IEEExplore
> * ACM Digital Library
> * Citeseer
> * Science Direct
>
> **Note 1**: Often the terms Background, Related Work or State of the Art are used interchangeably.  
> **Note 2**: Keyword search is wonderful, but you need the right Keywords.  
> **Note 2**: IEEExplore, ACM Digital Library and Science Direct require you to be on the College network to download the PDF of papers. If at home, use VPN.

Body
====

> At this stage you should be able to explain the main aspects of the solution that your project proposes.
> For more implementation based projects you should have already the main aspects of the architecture, the outline of the algorithms, etc.
> In essence, you should be able to write a specification of the solution in such level of detail that if given to an external programmer he should be able to implement it.
> Of course, some aspects of the solution may be missing, in which case you should be able to explain the main idea for tackling them.
>
> Final:
>
> The central part of the report usually consists of three of four chapters detailing the technical work undertaken during the project.
> The structure of these chapters is highly project dependent.
> They can reflect the chronological development of the project, e.g. design, implementation, experimentation, optimisation, evaluation etc. although this is not always the best approach.
> However you choose to structure this part of the report, you should make it clear how you arrived at your chosen approach in preference to the other alternatives documented in the background.
> If you have built a new piece of software you should describe and justify the design of your program at some high level, possibly using an approved graphical formalism such as UML.
> It should also document any interesting problems with, or features of, your implementation.
> Integration and testing are also important to discuss in some cases.
> You need to discuss the content of these sections thoroughly with your supervisor.


Evaluation
==========

> You should be able to explain how you are going to evaluate the resulting solution of the project in some amount of detail.
> In particular you should explain which aspects need to be evaluated for comparison with existing prior work, what qualitative and quantitative aspects will need evaluating, which tests and benchmarks you will run, etc.
>
> Final:
>
> Be warned that many projects fall down through poor evaluation.
> Simply building a system and documenting its design and functionality is not enough to gain top marks.
> It is extremely important that you evaluate what you have done both in absolute terms and in comparison with existing techniques, software, hardware etc.
> This might involve quantitative evaluation, for example based on numerical results, performance etc. or something more qualitative such as expressibility, functionality, ease-of-use etc.
> At some point you should also evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of what you have done.
> Avoid statements like "The project has been a complete success and we have solved all the problems asssociated with blah...; - you will be shot down immediately!
> It is important to understand that there is no such thing as a perfect project.
> Even the very best pieces of work have their limitations and you are expected to provide a proper critical appraisal of what you have done.

Plan of Work
============

> You must explain what remains to be done in order to complete the project and roughly what you expect the timetable to be (allowing sufficient time to write the final report, presentation and work on the final demonstration).
> It is not sufficient to simply give a timetable, you must also explain what the fall-back positions are if you run out of time and what extensions can be added if you have more time.
> You should be able to succinctly discuss the relative priority of the remaining tasks and its rationale.
